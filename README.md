ABOUT THIS PROJECT - RECRUMAX:


This project RecruMax aims to provide a common 
platform where the companies can recruit candidates by
conducting online assessments and the interested candidates who
search for a job can take the assessment set by the corresponding
company. This will make many things easier and save time because
online assessments can offer valuable insights of candidate
aptitude and with automated hiring procedures extreme efforts
can be reduced. On this platform multiple online tests can be
conducted to determine the professional abilities of a candidate.
These online assessments assist to recognize candidates who are
well coordinated with needed job roles and help in the hiring
process. Also shortlisting candidates is again a time consuming
and tedious job for recruiters. It takes hours for resume screening
for multiple candidates to be shortlisted just for a single hire. So
pre-hire assessments for shortlisting the candidates can also be
done using this platform.The recruitment examination process is handled by this
system RecruMax is as follows.
The candidate will be having an account after
registration.They can apply for the jobs in which the exams will be
conducted by a particular company. Companies after their
registration on this site can add jobs and its exam. They can set
question papers for the exams using this platform for a particular
job. The exams can be attended by the candidates. The candidates
can see their selection status after completion of the exam. The
company can check the results and the inference report. By
viewing the performance of all the candidates,they can select or
reject a candidate.The candidate can also give their feedback.
Companies and the administrator can view the feedback. The
administrator can also view all the users and with the feedback the
site can be improved in a better way.
