ONLINE EXAM PORTAL FOR RECRUITMENT

RecruMax is a platform designed to bridge the gap between job seekers and employers by providing an exam portal. This project automates several recruitment activities, including conducting exams for applicants, preparing questions and answers, and processing results efficiently. By doing so, RecruMax helps eliminate less suitable candidates and enables employers to select the most qualified individuals for the job.
